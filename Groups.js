/* 
    Define a Class Group. Group has 
    add, delete, and has methods. 
    Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds 
    a value to the group, and delete removes its 
    argument from the group and has returns a Boolean 
    value indicating that  the argument is a member of the group. 
    There is also a static (attached to the Class rather than instances of the Class) 
    'from' method that takes an iterable object, and creates a group 
    that has all the values produced from iterating over it.
